# BullCow
Bull Cow game Udemy project. Basically a console game in a 3d environment where the player guesses a hidden word
All art assets were provided by the Udemy course in the form of a starter kit. However, all code and functionality was handled by me.
The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word without failing too many times, think hangman but you guess the whole word instead of the letters.
